You can find the code in the notebook Keras_Demo_R_.ipynb which you can [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anadiedrichs/tensoRflowLite/blob/master/Keras_Demo_R_.ipynb)

Then I tried different things to convert this binary file on R (see tutorial.R) to a C file which has the specification indicated in
